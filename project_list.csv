Projects,hierarchy diagram,admin,as is,hierarchy_diagram,"This experiment juxtaposes Census population counts with a hierarchy diagram to show what is contained within each type of Census geography and how each relates to others in the system.",https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/censusGeographicHierarchy/
Projects,geographies explainer,admin,as is,geographies,"This experiment uses data for population, area, and density to show the range and diversity of 4 nested Census geographies- county, tract, block group, and block and 1 additional geography ZCTA. What are the biggest and smallest, densist and sparsest of each type of geography?",https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/censusGeography/
Projects,dashboard,admin,as is,dash,"This experiment is a dashboard that allows filtering by range within each vulnerability measure of the Social Vulneralbility Index. It shows the distribution of scores for subsets of census tracts.",https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/svi_dash/
Projects,admin intrastructure,admin,as is,admin_infrastructure,"This experiment overlaps a set of 10 administrative borders to show how they intersect. If we live in New York City, then we live in a place where these boundaries align and diverge. Use it to find the 10 jurisdictions you live or work in and how they connect you to the rest of the city.",https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/admin_infrastructure/
Projects,How are we vulnerable,svi,as is,checklist,"This experiment breaks apart the Social Vulnerability down to each of its 15 metrics to show how measures of vulnerability add up for each census tract in new york city. It allows users to turn specific metrics on and off to isolate  different combinations of vulnerability measures.",https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/SVI//1.html
Projects,every tract,svi,as is,everydot,"This experiment draws a dot for every census tract and sorts them according to different criteria within the SVI. It uses GL to quickly render and animate all 80k dots.",https://jjjiia.github.io/SVI_matches/tractsGL.html
